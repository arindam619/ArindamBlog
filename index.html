          <p class="postDate">posted on: 7 January 2014</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            I startle awake as the inner dawn broke. I could feel my being come back to life again. Unhurried, at peace, I feel at ease with myself. I loiter around the pleasant mindstreet contented with the feeling of fullness. My unshapely features glower with satisfaction. I loiter around some more, smiling at myself. Looking around, feeing so happy in my mindstreet.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            But as I go on, I realize I do not see any familiar turns, corners, or subways. I wander some more, looking for some semblance of recognition. Maybe the fir tree down the lane, maybe the unused subway, but to no avail. My ears stand attentive, trying to grasp the familiar sound of leaves rustling, or the distant howl of a dog, but again in vain. Drops of sweat, or tears, or both trickles down my chin onto the unfamiliar lane in my which I am. I look up in exasperation as I realize, I am alone in this empty mindstreet.
          </p>
          <!-- <pre>code goes here</pre> -->
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
           The heaviness of my solidarity burdens my being. I know I need to rest. I let myself relax. But I can’t. My being agonizes as alienated emotions run through it.  Any possibility of a path to familiarity, to recognition seems unlikely. I try to still myself, as my being cripples from tiredness and fragility. Slowly, yet not peacefully, I lose myself in this empty mindstreet.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            When I wake up, I am at peace again. I am flushed by familiar emotions of plenum and serenity. I happily come to the realization that I have returned to my mindstreet. I open my eyes to drink in my familiar view, only to realize that I am in the very same place I was. But I no longer feel alone, scared. I feel at ease. I realize this is my mindstreet, only that it’s no longer empty. It has me.

          <h2 class="title">Will I remain, will I cease?</h2>
          <p class="postDate">posted on: 3 December 2013</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            It’s been a long while since he last came. The emerald shining at the end of the room on the doorknob the only hope left. I sit mum, waiting, patient. Yet a tinge of fear runs across my small being. <em>Will I remain, will I cease?</em>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            What was that? I react, my wholeness shuddering with anticipation as I hear a distant click, my attention undivided to it as ever. My senses tingle as the emerald on the doorknob shows movement, subtle, yet so meaningful. A motion so small, yet so powerful. A ray enters, then a beam. I glisten, bathing in the glory.  The beam grows larger, powerful, filling the room with its bright crimson glow. A sudden burn on my being divides my attention. My happiness turns to fear. I feel pale, not that I change colour. This brightness captures me, conquers me and yet burns me. I look around, trying to find a single hint of my being. I try to control my disquietude. But my being wonders. . . <em>Will I remain, will I cease?</em>
          </p>
          <!-- <pre>code goes here</pre> -->
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            And then his shadow falls across the gleaming light. His being has grown small since I last saw him. The shadow tells his hunch is now prominent. I silently pray for him to move. He steps forward, and the blessed shadow falls on me. I feel the coolness of his shade, my master, my universe. The creator comes near. He begins to look for a canvas among the dilapidated remains of what once used to be the abode of creation. I twist and twirl in anticipation as he chooses the colours. His brush strikes the canvas. Colour splashes across his face too. A tiny cringe of a smile spreads across his face as he brushes it off. I reflect and beam in his happiness. His face returns to the usual focussed. He keeps flooding the canvas with colour. Each stroke a different story, a vivid emotion. I stare, astonished, dumfounded at his brilliance. Yet the thought remains, <em>Will I remain, will I cease?</em>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            A sudden jolt wakes me up. I feel my being swayed from the palette. I touch the canvas with fervour as the brush moves away. A new home again , as I glean with happiness. But the emotion ceases as my master brow creases with disapproval. He dips the brush in a new colour and goes on. I shudder with heightened fear. <em>Will I remain, will I cease?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            What am I? A tiny detail on this giant canvas. Maybe her bindi, maybe a freckle on her saari. . .
            He continues to add details to her, feverish, with a certain urgency. He knew this would be his last.
            I stay humble, calm and relaxed. But my heart pounds every time he runs the brush on the canvas.
            <em>Will I remain, will I cease?</em>
